<h1 align="center">Modern Blog Page</h1>
<p>This proyekt is built using React, one of the modern web development technologies. This page has been carefully designed to impress users and present information.

Cards on the page are elements that allow users to quickly access interesting and visually rich content. Each card represents a blog post with a headline, image, summary, and more. In this way, it is intended that visitors quickly understand what topics they can find content about.

In addition, the contact section of the page includes a contact form that allows visitors to easily get in touch. Users can provide feedback, ask questions or communicate. This feature is integrated to encourage user engagement and community building.

One of the most remarkable features of the page is the change mode feature. This feature allows users to view the page design in their preferred light or dark theme. In this way, users can have a comfortable experience in accordance with different light conditions.

Also, the page has a responsive design. This allows users to view the page comfortably on different devices. The design automatically adapts to screen sizes and ensures content is placed neatly.</p>
